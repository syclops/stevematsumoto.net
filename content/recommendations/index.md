Even though I don't get to do it as often as I'd like, I really enjoy traveling.
Over the years, I've collected a great deal of recommendations that I often want
to share with people. Emailing that list around to people each time became a bit
tedious, so I have started to maintain the list here. I try my best to keep the
list up to date, but if you notice a link is broken or some information is
incorrect, please let me know.

These recommendations are almost for food and drink, which is typically what I
tend to seek out when exploring a new place.

**Note:** if I do not personally know you and you contact me about adding
something to this list, your message will be ignored. I have gotten quite a lot
of requests to add places or links, and I don't have the time to look through
all of them, particularly for people I don't know.

# North America

## United States

### California

While it is quite hyped, if you are in California, I would definitely try
[In-N-Out](https://www.in-n-out.com/) at least once. As far as fast food goes,
their quality is quite good, though be aware that most locations get very
crowded during any given meal time. They have a pretty large number of
[locations](https://www.in-n-out.com/locations), and they also have a ["secret"
menu](https://www.in-n-out.com/menu/not-so-secret-menu.aspx).

#### Bay Area (ish)

* [Arsicault Bakery](https://www.facebook.com/arsicaultbakery/) (San Francisco)
* [Billco's Billiards and Darts](https://www.facebook.com/BillcosBilliards/)
  (Napa)
* [Cowgirl Creamery](https://www.cowgirlcreamery.com/) (San Francisco)
* [Haberdasher](https://www.haberdashersj.com/) (San Jose): one of my favorite
  cocktail bars of all time. If you make a reservation (or if they aren't too
  crowded), you can basically have them suggest a cocktail for you, and they
  will ask you a series of questions to help determine what kind of cocktail you
  might enjoy.

  a pretty diverse offering of beers and awesome decorations. Their flagship
  location is in [Point
  Loma](http://www.moderntimesbeer.com/tasting-room/point-loma) near Old Town,
  but they also have a variety of other locations on the West Coast. I
  particularly like their IPAs and sours.
* [Tacos El Gordo](http://tacoselgordobc.com/): my favorite taco place. The food
  is high quality, though be aware that there are usually separate lines for
  each type of filling (marked with signs). Also, be sure to check their
  [locations](http://tacoselgordobc.com/locations/), as similarly-named places
  are nearby. They also have locations in the Las Vegas area.
